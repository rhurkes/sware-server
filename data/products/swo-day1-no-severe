Southerly\nlow-level winds ahead of the front will continue to moisten the\nregion, leading to a corridor of marginal CAPE values by late\nafternoon.  Virtually all 12z model guidance is consistent in the\ndevelopment of scattered showers and a few thunderstorms along/ahead\nof the front later today.  Shear profiles would be conditionally\nconducive for organized/rotating updrafts.  However, weak low-level\nconvergence/shear and some weak capping inversion are expected to\nlimit updraft strength and resultant severe risk.  One or two cells\nmay briefly approach severe limits producing hail, but the overall\nrisk appears to warrant a continuation of less-than-5% hail\nprobabilities at this time.\n\n$$\n\n"
