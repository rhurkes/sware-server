By 00Z, the trough should extend from\nparts of MN/IA southwestward over KS.  By 12Z, it should reach Lower\nMI, northern IN, southern IL and the Mid-South. \n\nAt the surface, 11Z analysis showed a frontal-wave low over eastern\nKS, with cold front southwestward across northwestern OK and the TX\nPanhandle.  A warm front was drawn from the low eastward over\ncentral MO, southern IL, central IN, and east-central KY.  The warm\nfront, reinforced baroclinically by extensive convective precip now\nto its north over portions of IL/IN/OH, should move northeastward\nacross southern/central parts of IL/IN/OH through the day, perhaps\nreaching northern IN and west-central/northwestern OH. \nUncertainties in warm-frontal position still exist due to strength/\ntiming of the retreat of the stable air produced by that precip. \nThe surface cyclone should deepen through the period as it ejects\nnortheastward, reaching northeastern IN by 00Z and Lake Ontario by\n12Z.  The trailing cold front will sweep eastward/southeastward\nacross the outlook areas, reaching portions of IN, western KY,\neastern/southern AR, and south-central TX by 00Z.  By 12Z, the cold\nfront should extend from parts of western/central PA down the Blue\nRidge area to northern GA, southern AL, and the northwestern Gulf. \n\n...Ohio Valley to TX coastal plain...\nScattered to locally numerous thunderstorms, mainly in broken to\nsolid bands, are expected to develop along and ahead of the surface\ncold front beginning around midday and lasting into tonight.  As\nthis convection crosses the outlook area, all modes of severe will\nbe possible from a blend of QLCS features (LEWPs/bows), embedded\nsupercells, and perhaps a few discrete to semi-discrete supercells\nahead of the main line.  The main threat in a coverage/duration\nsense still is damaging wind, especially over the enhanced-risk\narea. \n\nWithin that, however, an enhanced afternoon/evening tornado risk\nalso is becoming apparent from the region of the progressive warm\nfrontal zone into IN/OH, southwestward to the MO Bootheel area. \nTornado risk appears most concentrated in a northeastward-aligned\ncorridor where at least a brief window is apparent for discrete or\nline-embedded supercells to encounter a favorable CAPE-shear\nparameter space.  This includes:\n1.  A higher-buoyancy, strong deep-shear regime around the MO\nBootheel and western KY, as well as \n2.  Farther up the Ohio Valley where the main convective maturation\narea will encounter relatively backed near-surface winds and quite\nlarge SRH/hodographs in the vicinity of the warm-frontal zone, and\nsomewhat into the warm sector, southeast of the surface low. \nForecast soundings suggest a gradual transition from larger midlevel\nlapse rates with higher CAPE and lower (but still favorable) shear\nin the southwest half of the severe-outlook corridor to lower-CAPE/\nhigh-shear regime over the Ohio Valley.  Surface-based effective-\ninflow parcels, low LCL and effective SRH 400-600 J/kg may develop\namidst 800-1500 J/kg MLCAPE, based on modified forecast soundings.  \n\nThe addition of enhanced-level tornado probabilities is the main\nupdate to the outlook for now.  A few significant tornadoes may\noccur as well, especially near the warm-frontal zone and western\npart of the enhanced-risk area where relatively discrete convection\nis more probable.  Should potential for longer-lived supercells and/\nor more-sustained bowing structures become apparent, categorical\nupgrade to moderate-level wind or tornado probabilities may be\nneeded in a future update.  For now, a little too much mode/\nlongevity uncertainty still exists to support such a jump.\n\nOtherwise, relatively minor adjustments have been made to\naccommodate forecast convection initiation/maturity potential as\nwell as eastern/southern extent of evening/overnight potential from\nthe Appalachians to the Gulf Coast.\n\n..Edwards/Broyles.. 04/03/2018\n\n$$\n\n"
