This continued\nwarm-air advection, aided by broad large-scale ascent, will likely\nlead to the persistence of thunderstorms for the next several hours.\nEven so, instability continues to wane amidst nocturnal cooling and\nwarming aloft resulting from multiple rounds of storms in the same\nareas. Expectation is for isolated instances of hail resulting from\nbrief updraft intensification due to storm interactions amidst\nmoderate vertical shear (i.e. 0-6 km bulk shear around 40-50 kt).\nIsolated and brief nature to this threat will preclude the need for\nan additional watch.\n\nAn extension in time may be warranted across the Permian Basin where\nthe storm moving through Andrews County TX continues to show a\nstrong updraft capable of severe hail. The organized character of\nthis storm may allow it to persist longer, with the resulting severe\nthreat extending past the watch expiration time of 07Z.\n\n..Mosier/Guyer.. 04/23/2019\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...OUN...SJT...LUB...MAF...\n\nLAT...LON   33010286 34949949 33929881 32000219 33010286 \n\n"
