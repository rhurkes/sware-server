A\nweak wave is also expected to move northeastward along the front\nfrom just south of CLL this morning to northern LA by late this\nevening, in response to a midlevel trough ejecting\neast-northeastward over the southern Plains through tonight. \nLow-level mass response to the weak wave/ejecting midlevel trough\nwill result in some increase in low-level shear from southeast TX\ntoday to the Ark-La-Miss by early tonight.  Embedded surface-based\nsupercells and/or QLCS mesovortices will be possible within the\nconvective bands along or just south of the quasi-stationary front,\npotentially producing a few tornadoes in a moist environment with\neffective SRH in excess of 300 m2/s2.  Otherwise, the threat for\nlarge hail will be greater across south and southeast TX in\nproximity to the steeper midlevel lapse rates and where storms may\noccasionally remain more discrete.  A few damaging gusts will be\npossible along the convective bands, potentially as far northeast as\nnorthern MS and vicinity along the northeast edge of the weakly\nunstable surface warm sector into tonight.\n\n..Thompson/Picca.. 03/28/2018\n\n$$\n\n"
