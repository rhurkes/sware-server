Several inches \naccumulated in that band in only a few hours. Meanwhile, \nwidespread showers and thunderstorms across southern MN continue \nto lift northeast. Temperatures aloft are above freezing, as \nevident in bright-banding and the mostly rain or sleet obs so far.\nRadar does indicate this bright-banding starting to erode near \nthe MN river in east central MN, and this could be the beginning \nof a transition to accumulating snow. Hi- res models continue to \nbe very bullish on QPF for the next several hours before this band\nbegins to taper off and sink south during the overnight hours. \nSome of this could be due to being fooled by the bright-banding \nissue. Nonetheless, expecting steady snow from near New Richmond \nsouthwest across the cities and into southwest MN. 3 to 5 inches \nare possible in this corridor through 2 AM. Areas to the south \nwill remain rain/freezing rain or sleet until very late tonight or\nSaturday.\n\nNot too much is currently falling across west central MN. Still\nexpecting snow to fill in tonight or early Saturday morning, so\nwill leave the Blizzard Warning as is for now but the severe impacts\nwill be delayed. \n\nEarlier the models had been delaying surging the second round\nnorthward to late Saturday morning or even the afternoon hours. \nRecent runs have sped that back up by a few hours. Will continue \nto monitor that trend. \n\n&&\n\n.SHORT TERM...(This evening through Saturday)\nIssued at 330 PM CDT Fri Apr 13 2018\n\nA very powerful winter storm will bring over a foot of snow to some \nlocations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. This storm has a lot of \nmoisture, with strong forcing for ascent with subfreezing \ntemperatures. What that in mind, it is certainly reasonable that a \nfew locations in southwest Minnesota will get near 18 inches of \nsnow. In addition, strong northeast wind will cause blizzard \nconditions.\n\nThis set up for this cyclone is textbook with a strong low level \ntemperature gradient, amplified upper level trough, and deep \nreservoir of potential vorticity. The heaviest snow will fall where \nthese three ingredients work together in southwest Minnesota. \nMeanwhile, areas in central MN and western WI will see two round of \nprecipitation which is nicely depicted by the HiRes models. The \nfirst round is tied to the warm air advection and Fgen. As of 3 pm, \nthis band was starting to take shape along I-94. \n\nThere should be a brief break in the precipitation tonight as it \nchanges to mainly a wintry mix and snow, but then expect another \nband of heavy snow to lift up from the south on Saturday. This band \nof snow is tied to the positive vorticity advection associated with \nthe Upper Level shortwave. These lobes of vorticity are difficult to \ntime, but the HiRes models continue to reflect the message of the \nsynoptic scale models and have 1-2\"/hr snow bands moving through on \nSaturday afternoon and evening. Meanwhile a well-defined TROWAL will \nkeep the highest snowfall amounts tied to this upper level wave. \n\nForecast models have trended a bit light with winds, and further \nsouth with the precipitation. Tried to reflect this in the forecast, \nso have lesser amounts of snow to the north. This centers the \nsnowband from Redwood Falls through the Twin Cities and Eau Claire. \nThe 19Z RAP13 and 18Z Nam continue this southern shift, so that will \nbe the main concern going forward and if the trend continues will \nlikely see the heavy snow axis shift south.\n\n.LONG TERM...(Saturday night through Friday)\nIssued at 330 PM CDT Fri Apr 13 2018\n\nIf you're hoping for a huge warmup during the latter portion of the \nforecast period, there isn't much good news for you. The upper flow \nwill become fairly progressive, but without any prolonged \nsignificant ridging in our area. So, although temperatures may be a \nbit warmer than the past week or two, they still look to remain \nbelow normal. The main weather feature of interest/concern is a \nshortwave trough and associated surface low that will move through \nthe region Tuesday night and Wednesday. The model guidance is \nactually in fairly good agreement on the evolution of this feature, \nand unfortunately (if you're looking for Spring) precipitation type \nwith it looks to partially if not mostly snow. Forcing looks to be \ncompact and focused with the upper wave, but there will be decent \nmoisture in place, so the 0.25-0.50\" inches of precipitation most of \nthe guidance suggests seems reasonable. So, could be another \naccumulating snow event for portions of the area. Other than that \nsystem, the Monday through Friday time frame will be dry with the \naforementioned below normal temperatures.\n\n&&\n\n.AVIATION...(For the 00Z TAFS through 00Z Saturday evening)\nIssued at 907 PM CDT Fri Apr 13 2018\n\nShowers and thunderstorms across southern MN continue to lift\nnorth and turn to snow north of the MN river. Expecting bands of\nheavy snow to develop from along the MN river to MSP and possibly\nRNH late this evening before drier air begins to erode the snow \nfrom the north overnight. Could see several inches accumulate \nbefore this occurs, but much will depend on surface temperature. \nOtherwise, AXN and STC should be mostly out of the steadier snow \nuntil Saturday afternooon and a mix should turn over to snow at\nRWF during the next few hours. \n\nKMSP...A very tricky forecast tonight, but precip has just turned\nover to all snow so this may be the beginning of the accumulation\nperiod. Could see inch/hr rates late this evening. The snow \nshould taper off overnight before starting again Saturday. Timing \nmay need to be adjusted again for the arrival of snow Saturday, \nbut will reassess for the 06Z TAF issuance.\n\n/OUTLOOK FOR KMSP/\nSun...IFR/MVFR with lingering snow.
