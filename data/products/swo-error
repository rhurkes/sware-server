Along and south of the boundary, dew\npoints are in the low 70s F. Diabatic heating in the wake of\novernight/morning convective has allowed temperatures south of the\nboundary to warm into low to mid 80s F, resulting in modest\ndestabilization (MLCAPE 1500-2500 J/kg). Effective bulk shear of\n35-45 kt will help to maintain multicellular organization of\nconvection occurring in this region through peak heating. \n\nGiven the largely unidirectional shear profiles, severe hail and a\nfew damaging wind gusts are possible with these storms. At this\ntime, the most probable corridor of severe potential (i.e.,\noverlapping evolution of CAPE/shear combo) appears to be confined to\nthe eastern part of the MCD area, over portions of central/eastern\nKentucky, southern Ohio, and West Virginia (ahead of the ongoing\nconvective activity). Should storms here continue to organize and\nbecome more widespread, a watch may be needed.\n\n..Karstens/Hart.. 05/23/2019\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...RLX...JKL...ILN...LMK...OHX...IND...PAH...ILX...\nMEG...LSX...SGF...\n\nLAT...LON   38149066 37629121 36779094 36378826 37268560 37438427\n            37258259 38078192 39068254 39538389 39648594 38688754\n            38208905 38149066 \n\n"
