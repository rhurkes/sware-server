The primary focus for severe storms will be a progressive and\ndeepening shortwave trough moving across the central Plains.  A\ndeepening surface low and cold front in advance of this system will\nsweep across the risk area this afternoon through tonight, resulting\nin a fast-moving squall line extending from IL/IN/OH southward into\nthe Mid South.  Visible satellite imagery shows broken cloud cover\nacross most of the warm sector, promoting heating and\ndestabilization.  Forecast soundings suggest a corridor of moderate\nCAPE values ahead of the front by mid-afternoon as thunderstorms\nbegin to form.  Initial activity may be supercellular in nature,\nwith a risk of tornadoes (some strong) and large hail from northeast\nAR/western MS into parts of southern IL/IN and western KY. \nEventually, the storms should congeal into a line with multiple\nbowing segments as it progresses across the MDT and ENH risk areas\nwith the potential for widespread damaging winds and a few QLCS\ntornadoes.\n\n...TX/LA...\nScattered strong to severe thunderstorms have developed this morning\nover central TX, ahead of a southern stream shortwave trough.  This\nactivity will persist through the day and spread into LA, with a\nrisk of large hail and damaging wind gusts.  By mid-afternoon,\nthunderstorms are expected to form along the advancing cold front\nand affect these same areas.\n\n...IN/OH...\nA persistent cluster of thunderstorms is affecting much of\ncentral/northern IN and OH.  The air mass south of the activity\ncontinues to warm, leading to a favorable environment for\nsevere/supercell thunderstorms.  This corridor remains in the higher\ntornado/damaging wind probability area for both warm frontal\nactivity this afternoon, and the squall line activity later today.\n\n..Hart.. 04/03/2018\n\n$$\n\n"
