This will largely occur in association with the\nnortheastward migration of a weak wave along an effective warm\nfrontal zone/zone of enhanced low-level convergence.  Strengthening\nof southerly 850 mb flow to 40-50 kt appears likely to accompany\nthis feature.  This will contribute to enlarging low-level\nhodographs along the boundary, supportive of supercell structures\nwith a risk for potentially damaging wind gusts and perhaps a couple\nof tornadoes.  Northeast of the Vicksburg area, thermodynamic\nprofiles/instability still appears somewhat marginal, but this may\nchange during the next couple of hours with continued low-level\nmoistening.\n\n..Kerr.. 03/28/2018\n\n...Please see www.spc.noaa.gov for graphic product...\n\nATTN...WFO...MEG...JAN...\n\nLAT...LON   33189084 34139008 34498933 34078856 32918941 32209065\n            31669155 31719186 32459121 33180084 \n\n\n"
